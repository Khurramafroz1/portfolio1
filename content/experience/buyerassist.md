### Project Title: **AI-Assisted Cardiovascular Disease Diagnostics**  
**Team Name:** Soreno  
**Guide:** Prof. Sitikantha Roy (Department of Applied Mechanics and ScAI, IIT Delhi), Dr. Neeraj Awasthy (Director of Pediatric Cardiology, Fortis Escorts Okhla, Delhi)

As a **GDC INDUCT Fellow** at IIT Madras, I was selected to be a part of a team working on an **AI-assisted diagnostic tool** for cardiovascular diseases. Our project aimed to address the growing challenges within India's healthcare system, where there is a significant **burden on cardiologists in urban areas**, as well as a **scarcity of specialists in rural regions**. The goal of this project was to create an **AI-powered screening tool** that not only lightens the workload for cardiologists in high-density urban hospitals but also extends access to cardiovascular diagnosis in underserved, low-resource regions.

### Key Contributions:

1. **Business Ideation and Genesis**  
   - Participated in **structured ideation workshops** at GDC to translate deep-tech research into a scalable commercial solution.
   - Collaborated with **faculty, clinicians, and industry experts** to define the project’s core business vision, emphasizing AI-driven diagnostics as both a clinical support tool for overburdened doctors and a cost-effective solution for rural health workers.
   - Drafted the initial **vision document** that focused on the social impact, technical innovation, and market potential, aiming to democratize access to high-quality cardiac care.

2. **Technology and Clinical Alignment**  
   - Worked closely with **Prof. Sitikantha Roy** to tailor the AI model development for real-world constraints such as **portability, computational efficiency**, and **cost-effectiveness**, which are essential for scaling AI solutions in resource-limited environments.
   - Engaged with **Dr. Neeraj Awasthy** to refine the tool’s clinical workflows for use in high-risk scenarios like **congenital heart disease screening in children** and **rheumatic heart disease detection** in adolescents.
   - Developed a **technology adoption roadmap** to ensure smooth integration of the AI diagnostic tool into existing hospital infrastructures and mobile health platforms for wide-scale implementation.

3. **Ecosystem Study and Stakeholder Mapping**  
   - Conducted an **in-depth ecosystem study** of India’s healthcare system, specifically the **cardiology** sector, identifying key players in diagnostics and devices.
   - Mapped the key stakeholders including **primary care providers, cardiologists, procurement teams**, and **health-tech regulators** to better understand their pain points, incentives, and opportunities for collaboration.
   
4. **Primary Market Research and Need Assessment**  
   - Conducted **interviews with over 26 leading cardiologists** and healthcare administrators across major Indian cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad) to assess the real-world clinical needs and challenges.
   - Key findings included:
     - In **tier-1 cities**, cardiologists expressed a strong need for AI tools to assist with triage, **risk stratification**, and **diagnostic decision-making** due to overwhelming patient volumes.
     - In **tier-2/3 towns and rural areas**, a shortage of specialists led to a demand for AI-powered screening tools that could be operated by general physicians or health workers.
   - Identified challenges such as the **lack of interoperability** with hospital IT systems, **skepticism towards AI’s accuracy**, and **regulatory hurdles** in achieving clinical validation.

5. **Business Strategy and Commercial Roadmap**  
   - Developed a **business plan** under the mentorship of Mr. Ganesan V.R., focusing on **customer segmentation**, **go-to-market strategy**, and **revenue models**.
   - Created a plan for pilot implementations in **CSR-funded rural healthcare programs** and hospitals looking to innovate their cardiac care offerings.
   - Proposed a **device licensing model**, complemented by **SaaS-based analytics dashboards** and long-term **data monetization** through hospital and insurance partnerships.

6. **Customer Ecosystem and Product Adoption Strategy**  
   - Mapped out the **customer journey**, outlining decision-makers such as department heads, administrators, and clinical technology officers.
   - Simulated the adoption process, identifying **barriers to integration** and ensuring smooth transitions from prototype to full-scale deployment.
   
7. **Market Opportunity and Competitive Analysis**  
   - Conducted a **competitive analysis** of AI-powered cardiovascular diagnostic tools, benchmarking **Soreno** against existing solutions in both **Indian startups** and **global companies**.
   - Identified a gap in the **pediatric cardiology** sector, with limited players targeting **low-cost, scalable diagnostic solutions** for rural and semi-urban areas.
   - Created market forecasts based on the **Total Addressable Market (TAM)** and **Serviceable Available Market (SAM)** for AI-driven diagnostic tools, projecting patient reach and revenue over the next 5 years.

### Outcome:

- Successfully developed an **AI-assisted screening tool** for cardiovascular diseases, focusing on both **urban hospitals** and **rural areas**.
- Gained invaluable exposure to the integration of **AI in healthcare** and learned how to align business and clinical goals to create scalable, impactful solutions.
- Provided a **roadmap for future scalability** and adoption, aiming to empower healthcare professionals and expand access to high-quality cardiac care in underserved regions.
