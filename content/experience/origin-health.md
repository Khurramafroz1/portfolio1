## ðŸ§  Machine Learning for Biomedical Disease Prediction  
**Guide:** Prof. Subramani Kanagaraj (Biomedical Device Lab, IIT Guwahati)

As part of a semester-long research initiative under the guidance of Prof. Subramani Kanagaraj, I worked on developing machine learning models aimed at improving disease prediction accuracy using biomedical datasets. The project spanned various stages of the machine learning lifecycle â€” from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model development, validation, and real-time implementation.

### ðŸ”¬ Key Contributions

- **Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression**  
  Built a predictive model leveraging logistic regression to estimate the probability of heart disease based on multiple clinical parameters (age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, etc.). The model was trained and tested on real-world datasets, and later integrated into a prototype for real-time inference, demonstrating potential as a decision-support tool in clinical settings.

- **Breast Cancer Classification using Neural Networks**  
  Developed a feedforward neural network to classify malignant and benign breast tumors using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset. Applied techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and learning rate scheduling to optimize model performance, achieving over 95% accuracy on test data.

- **Brain MRI Image Segmentation using U-Net**  
  Initiated research on applying U-Net, a convolutional neural network architecture, for semantic segmentation of brain MRI images. The objective was to identify tumor regions and anomalies, a crucial step in automated diagnosis of neurological conditions. Preprocessing involved skull stripping, normalization, and augmentation techniques to handle limited dataset availability.

### ðŸ“ˆ Outcome and Impact

- Successfully demonstrated that classical and deep learning models can be effectively used in biomedical diagnostics  
- Designed modular ML pipelines that can be adapted for additional diseases or imaging modalities  
- Gained hands-on experience with tools and libraries including Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV  
- Laid the groundwork for potential future research into explainable AI in medical imaging
