### Project Title: **Advancing Medical Imaging with Deep Learning: Ultrasound & Generative Models**

**Lab:** Care Computing Lab, IIT Delhi  
**Supervisor:** Prof. Monika Aggarwal

As a **PhD Researcher** in the **Care Computing Lab** at IIT Delhi, I have focused on the integration of cutting-edge **deep learning techniques** with medical imaging, specifically **ultrasound imaging**. My research aims to push the boundaries of medical diagnostics by developing advanced machine learning models, including the use of **CLIP-based models**, **diffusion models**, and **large language models (LLMs)**, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of ultrasound-based diagnostics in healthcare.

### Research Overview:
The primary objective of my research is to apply state-of-the-art AI technologies to enhance the interpretation of ultrasound images, which are widely used in clinical practice for diagnostics. Traditional ultrasound image interpretation requires expert knowledge, and our work seeks to improve both the **automated image analysis** and **predictive capabilities** for better decision-making. The integration of advanced deep learning models has the potential to enable **real-time, precise** diagnostic tools that can support clinicians, particularly in low-resource settings.

### Key Areas of Focus:

1. **Ultrasound Image Analysis with Deep Learning**:
   - Developed and fine-tuned **deep neural network models** (CNNs, U-Nets) to analyze ultrasound images for various applications, such as detecting anomalies, organ segmentation, and improving image resolution.
   - Implemented **multi-modal learning techniques**, combining ultrasound images with patient history and clinical data to improve diagnostic predictions and risk stratification.

2. **Generative Models: Diffusion Models & CLIP**:
   - Applied **diffusion models** for data augmentation in medical imaging, allowing the generation of synthetic ultrasound images that mimic real-world data, thus enhancing training datasets for deep learning models.
   - Integrated **CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining)** models to bridge the gap between visual and textual information, enabling ultrasound images to be analyzed in context with clinical notes, improving diagnostic interpretation and report generation.
   - Utilized **generative models** to synthesize ultrasound images with higher resolution and fidelity, allowing clinicians to examine even the subtlest of diagnostic features that would be missed in lower-quality images.


6. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration & Mentorship**:
   - Collaborated closely with experts in **medical imaging**, **radiology**, and **healthcare technology** to ensure the models met both technical and clinical needs.
   - Mentored master's and undergraduate students in the lab, helping them navigate the complexities of deep learning in healthcare applications.


### Impact and Future Directions:
The integration of **deep learning** with **ultrasound imaging** and **generative models** represents a significant advancement in medical technology. My work aims to create models that not only improve diagnostic performance but also democratize healthcare by enabling high-quality medical imaging in resource-constrained environments. In the future, I plan to explore the use of these models in more specialized fields such as **cardiology**, **oncology**, and **maternal health**.

This research is positioning itself at the intersection of AI, medical imaging, and healthcare accessibility, driving innovations that can transform how ultrasound technology is used in clinical practice.
