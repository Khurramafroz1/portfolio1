## ü©∫ Multimodal Deep Learning for Chest X-Ray‚ÄìBased Cardiology Diagnosis

At Augmented Medicine Pvt. Ltd., I worked as an AI Software Engineer in a core research and development role aimed at integrating artificial intelligence into radiological workflows to assist in the early detection and triaging of cardiovascular diseases using chest X-rays.

### üîç Project Focus

- Designed and implemented a **deep learning pipeline** for diagnosing heart-related diseases using chest X-ray (CXR) images as the primary input modality
- Integrated **multimodal inputs** including patient metadata (age, gender, medical history) to enhance model performance and contextual relevance
- The primary goal was to create a **high-specificity model** that minimizes false positives, allowing radiologists to confidently **rule out normal (negative) cases** and focus their attention on complex or abnormal cases

### üí° Key Technical Highlights

- Utilized pre-trained CNN architectures (e.g., DenseNet121, Inceptionv1 and fine-tuned them on large-scale public datasets like **NIH ChestX-ray14** and **CheXpert**
- Developed custom loss functions and **specificity-prioritized training strategies** to improve true-negative prediction rates, aligning with clinical needs for safe automation
- Incorporated **Grad-CAM and saliency maps** to provide explainability, highlighting pathological features that led to the model‚Äôs decision
- Employed **class imbalance handling** techniques (e.g., focal loss, weighted sampling) to address the natural skew in CXR datasets toward negative cases
- Deployed model evaluation frameworks with metrics such as **specificity, ROC-AUC, and precision-recall curves**, tailored to cardiology diagnostic thresholds

### üíº Clinical Relevance & Outcome

- Reduced radiologist workload by enabling **AI-driven triage**, automatically filtering normal cases for expedited review
- Provided decision support for early diagnosis of conditions such as cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, and congestive heart failure
- Demonstrated potential for integration into Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) for **real-time clinical application**
