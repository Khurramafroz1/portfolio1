## About Me

I'm a deep learning researcher and Ph.D. candidate chasing a timeless question: how do minds — biological or artificial — come to understand the world?

My work lives at the crossroads of AI, computational neuroscience, and cognitive modeling. I began in the body, teaching machines to see beneath the skin — denoising ultrasound, segmenting anatomy, restoring lost resolution through generative models. But beyond pixels and labels, I’m drawn to a deeper mystery:

**What if machines could learn not just to classify — but to think? To imagine, infer, and adapt as humans do?**

I study the computational roots of cognition — the internal scaffolds of thought that enable generalization, planning, theory of mind, and learning under uncertainty. I'm especially fascinated by how these mental structures arise, evolve, and support flexible intelligence.

To me, the brain isn’t just a metaphor for AI. It’s a proof of concept. A living demonstration that learning from noisy, partial, ambiguous data isn’t just possible — it’s natural, efficient, and robust.

Inspired by this, I build systems where perception, memory, and action are no longer siloed modules but intertwined faculties. Systems that don’t just solve problems — they understand why they matter.

Today's AI can dazzle, but it often crumbles when the world shifts. It predicts without knowing. It speaks without grounding. To truly advance, we must revisit the oldest questions — blending insights from neuroscience, psychology, and the philosophy of mind.
