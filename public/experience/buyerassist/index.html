  "articleBody": "Project Title: AI-Assisted Cardiovascular Disease Diagnostics Team Name: Soreno\nGuide: Prof. Sitikantha Roy (Department of Applied Mechanics and ScAI, IIT Delhi), Dr. Neeraj Awasthy (Director of Pediatric Cardiology, Fortis Escorts Okhla, Delhi)\nAs a GDC INDUCT Fellow at IIT Madras, I was selected to be a part of a team working on an AI-assisted diagnostic tool for cardiovascular diseases. Our project aimed to address the growing challenges within India’s healthcare system, where there is a significant burden on cardiologists in urban areas, as well as a scarcity of specialists in rural regions. The goal of this project was to create an AI-powered screening tool that not only lightens the workload for cardiologists in high-density urban hospitals but also extends access to cardiovascular diagnosis in underserved, low-resource regions.\nKey Contributions: Business Ideation and Genesis\nParticipated in structured ideation workshops at GDC to translate deep-tech research into a scalable commercial solution. Collaborated with faculty, clinicians, and industry experts to define the project’s core business vision, emphasizing AI-driven diagnostics as both a clinical support tool for overburdened doctors and a cost-effective solution for rural health workers. Drafted the initial vision document that focused on the social impact, technical innovation, and market potential, aiming to democratize access to high-quality cardiac care. Technology and Clinical Alignment\nWorked closely with Prof. Sitikantha Roy to tailor the AI model development for real-world constraints such as portability, computational efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, which are essential for scaling AI solutions in resource-limited environments. Engaged with Dr. Neeraj Awasthy to refine the tool’s clinical workflows for use in high-risk scenarios like congenital heart disease screening in children and rheumatic heart disease detection in adolescents. Developed a technology adoption roadmap to ensure smooth integration of the AI diagnostic tool into existing hospital infrastructures and mobile health platforms for wide-scale implementation. Ecosystem Study and Stakeholder Mapping\nConducted an in-depth ecosystem study of India’s healthcare system, specifically the cardiology sector, identifying key players in diagnostics and devices. Mapped the key stakeholders including primary care providers, cardiologists, procurement teams, and health-tech regulators to better understand their pain points, incentives, and opportunities for collaboration. Primary Market Research and Need Assessment\nConducted interviews with over 26 leading cardiologists and healthcare administrators across major Indian cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad) to assess the real-world clinical needs and challenges. Key findings included: In tier-1 cities, cardiologists expressed a strong need for AI tools to assist with triage, risk stratification, and diagnostic decision-making due to overwhelming patient volumes. In tier-2/3 towns and rural areas, a shortage of specialists led to a demand for AI-powered screening tools that could be operated by general physicians or health workers. Identified challenges such as the lack of interoperability with hospital IT systems, skepticism towards AI’s accuracy, and regulatory hurdles in achieving clinical validation. Business Strategy and Commercial Roadmap\nDeveloped a business plan under the mentorship of Mr. Ganesan V.R., focusing on customer segmentation, go-to-market strategy, and revenue models. Created a plan for pilot implementations in CSR-funded rural healthcare programs and hospitals looking to innovate their cardiac care offerings. Proposed a device licensing model, complemented by SaaS-based analytics dashboards and long-term data monetization through hospital and insurance partnerships. Customer Ecosystem and Product Adoption Strategy\nMapped out the customer journey, outlining decision-makers such as department heads, administrators, and clinical technology officers. Simulated the adoption process, identifying barriers to integration and ensuring smooth transitions from prototype to full-scale deployment. Market Opportunity and Competitive Analysis\nConducted a competitive analysis of AI-powered cardiovascular diagnostic tools, benchmarking Soreno against existing solutions in both Indian startups and global companies. Identified a gap in the pediatric cardiology sector, with limited players targeting low-cost, scalable diagnostic solutions for rural and semi-urban areas. Created market forecasts based on the Total Addressable Market (TAM) and Serviceable Available Market (SAM) for AI-driven diagnostic tools, projecting patient reach and revenue over the next 5 years. Outcome: Successfully developed an AI-assisted screening tool for cardiovascular diseases, focusing on both urban hospitals and rural areas. Gained invaluable exposure to the integration of AI in healthcare and learned how to align business and clinical goals to create scalable, impactful solutions. Provided a roadmap for future scalability and adoption, aiming to empower healthcare professionals and expand access to high-quality cardiac care in underserved regions. ",
