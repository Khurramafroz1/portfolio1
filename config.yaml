  # ## About Me
  #
  # I'm a deep learning researcher and Ph.D. candidate chasing a timeless question: how do minds — biological or artificial — come to understand the world?
  #
  # My work lives at the crossroads of AI, computational neuroscience, and cognitive modeling. I began in the body, teaching machines to see beneath the skin — denoising ultrasound, segmenting anatomy, restoring lost resolution through generative models. But beyond pixels and labels, I’m drawn to a deeper mystery:
  #
  # **What if machines could learn not just to classify — but to think? To imagine, infer, and adapt as humans do?**
  #
  # I study the computational roots of cognition — the internal scaffolds of thought that enable generalization, planning, theory of mind, and learning under uncertainty. I'm especially fascinated by how these mental structures arise, evolve, and support flexible intelligence.
  #
  # To me, the brain isn’t just a metaphor for AI. It’s a proof of concept. A living demonstration that learning from noisy, partial, ambiguous data isn’t just possible — it’s natural, efficient, and robust.
  #
  # Inspired by this, I build systems where perception, memory, and action are no longer siloed modules but intertwined faculties. Systems that don’t just solve problems — they understand why they matter.
  #
  # Today's AI can dazzle, but it often crumbles when the world shifts. It predicts without knowing. It speaks without grounding. To truly advance, we must revisit the oldest questions — blending insights from neuroscience, psychology, and the philosophy of mind.
  #
  # > If you’re building machines that don’t just compute but cognize — let’s talk.
  # > The future of AI isn’t just smarter. It’s more human.
